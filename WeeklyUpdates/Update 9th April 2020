1) Results for different cores. 
   1.1) Andre: Also run the same experiments with just Edge, Just fog, and just Cloud. The real schedule should be a sweet spot amongst the two experiments.
   1.2) Instead of multiple of 3, use smaller task number in the multiples of 2,4,8,16,32.....
2) Benchmark the resources
   2.1) Andre: Run the K-means on Rraspberry pi and Xsede mahcine ( Or can also run them on different VMs) to benchmarks the metrics: Such as performance, execution power, Latency
3) Using the generation concepts in Vivek's emulator, we can use more than one core for each task
4) Make the taks data dependent. Using the subprocesses library in python, the task now have an associated args_task field which can accept arguments to run executables. The execution time for a task now includes the time spent in running the executable.
